# spumble
Spumble is a way to collaboratively make a playlist with another Spotify user by allowing users to vote yes, no, or superlike on songs from both users' liked songs. Their matches are compiled into a playlist that is created on both users' Spotify accounts.

*created by Fabian Luna, Lisette Malacon, and Jaylene Martinez*

## Instructions to launch the project:
Install the following packages using `pip install [package-name]`:
```
spotipy
webbrowser
random
```

This app is still in developer mode. In order to give Spumble access to your Spotify account, email your full name and the email registered to your Spotify account to fabian.luna@stanford.edu so that it can be added to the list of users with access.

In the command line, run `python3 spumble.py` to begin the progam.
